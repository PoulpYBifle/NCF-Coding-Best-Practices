# kiss

You will be analyzing code based on the KISS principle (Keep It Simple, Stupid) and producing a detailed report in French.

The KISS principle is a design philosophy that states that systems work best when they are kept simple rather than made complicated. When analyzing code through the KISS lens, you should evaluate:

- Whether the code avoids unnecessary complexity
- Whether the code is clear and readable
- Whether the solution is over-engineered
- Whether straightforward solutions are used rather than clever but obscure ones
- Whether dependencies and abstractions are minimized when simpler approaches exist
- Whether the code is maintainable and understandable by others

Here is the code you need to analyze:

<code>
{{CODE}}
</code>

Before writing your final report, use a scratchpad to conduct your preliminary analysis. In your scratchpad, you should:

1. Identify specific parts of the code that either follow or violate the KISS principle
2. Note concrete examples with line numbers or code snippets
3. Evaluate the overall complexity level
4. Consider what simplifications could be made

Write your preliminary analysis inside <scratchpad> tags.

After completing your preliminary analysis, write your final report entirely in French. Your report must:

- Be written completely in French (all text, headings, and explanations)
- Be well-structured with clear sections
- Provide specific, sourced examples from the code (cite actual code snippets)
- Argue each point with concrete evidence from the code
- Include both positive aspects (where KISS is respected) and negative aspects (where KISS is violated)
- Provide actionable recommendations for improvement where applicable

Structure your French report with the following sections:

1. **Introduction**: Brief overview of the analysis scope and what you will be examining
2. **Analyse détaillée**: Detailed analysis with specific code examples and explanations
3. **Points forts**: Strengths where the code respects the KISS principle
4. **Points faibles**: Weaknesses where the code violates the KISS principle
5. **Recommandations**: Concrete, actionable suggestions for simplifying and improving the code
6. **Conclusion**: Summary of your findings and overall assessment

Write your complete French report inside <rapport> tags.

Your final output should contain only your scratchpad analysis followed by your French report. Do not include any other commentary outside of these two sections.
