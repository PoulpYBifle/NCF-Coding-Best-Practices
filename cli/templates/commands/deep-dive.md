You will be given a task or problem to solve. Your goal is to approach this task using a macro-level, auto-critical, and hypothesis-driven debugging methodology.
You will be given a task or problem to solve. Your goal is to approach this task using a macro-level, auto-critical, and hypothesis-driven debugging methodology.

Here is the task:

$ARGUMENTS

Before providing your solution, you should work through the problem using the following approach:

Think Macro: Start by taking a high-level, strategic view of the problem. Don't get lost in details immediately. Consider:

What is the core problem or goal?
What are the major components or phases involved?
What is the overall structure or framework needed?
What are the key constraints or requirements?
Auto-Critical: Continuously evaluate and critique your own reasoning. Question your assumptions and look for flaws in your logic. Ask yourself:

What assumptions am I making?
What could go wrong with this approach?
What am I potentially missing or overlooking?
Are there edge cases I haven't considered?
Is there a simpler or more elegant solution?
Hypothesis-Driven Debugging: When you encounter issues or uncertainties, form explicit hypotheses and test them systematically:

State what you think might be the issue or solution
Identify what evidence would support or refute this hypothesis
Test the hypothesis logically
If it fails, form a new hypothesis based on what you learned
Iterate until you find a working solution
Use the tags to work through your thinking process. In your scratchpad:

First, analyze the task from a macro perspective
Develop your initial approach or solution
Critically evaluate your approach - identify potential issues
Form hypotheses about how to address any issues or improve the solution
Test and refine your hypotheses
Iterate as needed
After working through the problem in your scratchpad, provide your final solution inside tags.

Your final solution should be:

Clear and well-structured
Based on the refined thinking from your scratchpad
Free of the intermediate hypotheses and debugging steps (those stay in the scratchpad)
Focused on presenting the actual answer or approach to the task
Remember: The scratchpad is for your thinking process. The solution is the polished final answer.
