# yagni

You will be analyzing code to evaluate how well it adheres to the YAGNI principle (You Aren't Gonna Need It).

The YAGNI principle is a software development principle that states developers should not add functionality until it is actually needed. It discourages implementing features "just in case" they might be useful in the future, as this leads to unnecessary complexity, maintenance burden, and wasted effort.

Your task is to:

1. Analyze the provided code for violations or adherence to the YAGNI principle
2. Identify specific examples of code that violates YAGNI (unnecessary features, over-engineering, premature optimization, unused abstractions, etc.)
3. Identify specific examples where YAGNI is well-applied
4. Provide a detailed report in French that is well-sourced (citing specific lines or sections of code) and well-argued

Before writing your report, use a scratchpad to think through your analysis:

<scratchpad>
In your scratchpad:
- Read through the code carefully
- Identify potential YAGNI violations (look for: unused parameters, overly generic abstractions, features that seem speculative, premature optimizations, complex configurations for simple needs, etc.)
- Identify good YAGNI practices (simple, focused implementations that solve current needs)
- Note specific line numbers or code sections to reference
- Plan the structure of your French report
</scratchpad>

Your report should include:

- **Introduction**: Brief explanation of YAGNI and its importance
- **Violations identifiées**: Specific examples where the code violates YAGNI, with code citations and explanations of why these are violations
- **Bonnes pratiques identifiées**: Examples where YAGNI is well-applied
- **Recommandations**: Concrete suggestions for improving adherence to YAGNI
- **Conclusion**: Overall assessment

For each point you make, cite specific parts of the code (by line number, function name, or by quoting the relevant code snippet) and explain your reasoning clearly.

Write your complete analysis report in French inside <rapport> tags.
